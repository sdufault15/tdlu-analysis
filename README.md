### Pregnancy hypertension and a commonly inherited IGF1R variant (rs2016347) reduce breast cancer risk by enhancing mammary gland involution

This repository contains all of the code and packages necessary to recreate the analysis in the 2019-submitted paper *Pregnancy hypertension and a commonly inherited IGF1R variant (rs2016347) reduce breast cancer risk by enhancing mammary gland involution* by Mark Powell, Christopher C Benz, Suzanne Dufault, Jill Henry, Renata Cora and Anna Allison. This code is provided as a commitment to increased scientific transparency and reproducibility. R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) -- "Joy in Playing" was used to produce the analyses found within these files. 

The folder structure is as follows:

- **docs** contains pdfs of all of the compiled analysis material including a short description of why the stratified results are not equivalent to the results with an interaction term
- **reports** contains all of the .Rnw code necessary to knit recreate the documents in **docs**
- **lib** contains any user written functions as well as the list of packages necessary to rerun the analysis
- **munge** contains the code to recreate the stratified box plots found in the paper
- **graphs** contains the tables and figures from the paper as well as additional illustrative figures and tables from the analysis

The R code within these folders may not be perfectly efficient, but is accurate and reproducible. If there are any questions about the analysis code, please contact us.
